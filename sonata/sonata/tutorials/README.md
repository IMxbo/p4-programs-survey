## Sonata Tutorials

### Installation
Follow the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/blob/tutorial/installation.md) 
to get started.

### Background
[Here](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/blob/tutorial/sonata/tutorials/background.md), 
we will first provide an overview of Sonata describing its architecture and 
how simplifies expressing queries for a range of telemetry applications. 

### Tutorial 1: Expressing Queries for Telemetry Applications
#### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/tree/tutorial/sonata/tutorials/Tutorial-1): COS 561
In this [tutorial](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/tree/tutorial/sonata/tutorials/Tutorial-1), 
we will learn how to express queries for a range of telemetry applications with 
Sonata. 

### Tutorial 2: Compiling Dataflow Queries for PISA Targets
#### Not part of Assignment 3 for COS 561
In this 
[tutorial](https://github.com/Sonata-Princeton/SONATA-DEV/tree/tutorial/sonata/tutorials/Tutorial-2), 
we will learn how to execute simple dataflow queries with PISA targets.
